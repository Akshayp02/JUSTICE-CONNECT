## Problem Statement

<br/>
<blockquote align='center'>
<h3>“An estimated 5 billion people have unmet justice needs globally, including people who cannot obtain justice for everyday problems”

\- The world justice project

</h3>
</blockquote>
<br/>

The report said that of the 5.1 billion people with no meaningful access to justice, an estimated 1.5 billion – one in five people worldwide – have been left with justice problems they cannot solve, whether that involves a land dispute, consumer debt or being the vicim of crime.

 <img src="https://worldjusticeproject.org/sites/default/files/inline-images/chart%201.2.png" alt="Image 1" style="width: 50%;">
      <p> </p>
      <p>An estimated 253 million people live in extreme conditions of injustice and are deprived of any meaningful legal protections: 40 million people are modern-day slaves, 12 million people are stateless, and 200 million live in countries or communities where levels of insecurity are so high that they are unable to seek justice, the team found. </p>
